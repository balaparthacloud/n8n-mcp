# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized protocol for managing and exchanging context between different components in a model-driven system. It provides a structured way to handle contextual information that models need to function effectively.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Context Format**: Defines a common structure for context data
- **Context Management**: Handles storage, retrieval and updates of context
- **Component Communication**: Enables seamless context sharing between system components
- **Extensibility**: Supports custom context types and handlers
- **Versioning**: Maintains context versions for compatibility

## Usage

MCP can be integrated into any model-based system that needs to:
- Share context between different models or components
- Maintain contextual state across operations
- Handle complex context dependencies
- Ensure consistent context handling

## Implementation

The protocol consists of:
1. Context Definition Layer
2. Context Management Layer  
3. Communication Layer
4. Extension Points

For detailed implementation guidelines, see the [MCP Specification](docs/mcp-spec.md).
